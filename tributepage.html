                    Robin McLaurin Williams (July 21, 1951 – August 11, 2014) was an American actor and comedian. Known
                    for
                    his improvisational skills and a wide variety of voices, he is often regarded as one of the
                    best comedians of all time. Williams began performing stand-up comedy in San Francisco and Los
                    Angeles during the mid-1970s, and rose to fame for playing the alien Mork in the sitcom Mork & Mindy
                    (1978–1982).
                </p>

                <p>Robin Williams was a famed actor and comedian
                    who captured the hearts of the world with his
                    remarkable wit and charismatic personality. During his career, he gave everything and proved that he
                    could impersonate both funny and dramatic characters.While a string of successful film roles made
                    him one of the world’s funniest performers, it was his serious role in Good Will Hunting that earned
                    him an Oscar.</p>

                <p>Williams suffered from drug and alcohol addiction, but eventually overcame it and maintained his
                    sobriety. He also suffered from depression and was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Unable to
                    cope with the fact that he would live the rest of his life with a degenerative disease, Williams
                    took his own life at the age of 63.</p>

                <p>Even today, his fans find it hard to accept the loss of a man who captured their hearts with his
                    outstanding performances as an artist.</p>
